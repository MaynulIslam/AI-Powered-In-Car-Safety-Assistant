# AI-Powered-In-Car-Safety-Assistant
Develop a real-time AI safety assistant that monitors driver behavior (e.g., drowsiness, distraction) and warns the driver or takes corrective actions.

**Technologies:** Computer Vision, Face Recognition, NLP (for voice commands), Drowsiness Detection models
**Goals:** Prevent accidents by detecting unsafe driving behavior and providing real-time alerts.

**Milestones:**
Train a computer vision model to detect drowsiness or distraction from driver images.
Integrate with in-car systems to provide audio/visual alerts or take actions like adjusting speed.
Test the system using a driving simulator or real-world scenarios.
